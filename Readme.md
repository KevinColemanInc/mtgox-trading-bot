# Trading Bot for mtgox

This was a project Kevin Coleman wrote back in 2012 in order to automate his trading strategies and potentially offer the algorithm to other people.

The project was shutdown before launch when mtgox closed while I was building the back testing tools.

# Features

- Bucketizes the raw trading data to daily, weekly, monthly groups for faster algorithm processing
- ~15 different trading strategies
- Backtesting against each trading window
- Live trading
- Post trades to Twitter (for proof that this accurately works)
- Sends trade alerts via email

# Technologies
- CSharp.net
- SQL Database

RIP mtgox
